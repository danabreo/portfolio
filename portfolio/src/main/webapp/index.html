      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>
        I am an incoming Junior at Texas A&M University, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
        I was born and raised in Houston, Texas near NASA's Johnson Space Center, 
        and I enjoy putting my software engineering skills to use in solving real-world problems.
